# Polygon Cafe: A Shopping Cart App and Restaurant Site

This is a website I made on spec for Polygon Cafe, a Chicago Northside Thai and Sushi restaurant. It features the Google Maps API as well as a shopping cart app and mock checkout functionality with React Forms.

I started this project because I wanted learn more advanced skills in React while simultaneously striving to improve my sense of design.
